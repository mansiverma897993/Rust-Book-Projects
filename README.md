# Rust-Book-Projects

Welcome to my Rust Learning Repository â€” a collection of notes, code examples, and projects inspired by The Rust Programming Language
 (a.k.a. The Rust Book), along with hands-on exercises from Rustlings
.

This repo follows the structure of The Rust Book chapter by chapter, pairing theory with practice and small projects.
